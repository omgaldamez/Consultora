    "The given code is designed to process a hierarchical JSON data structure, extract relevant information, and generate a new JSON structure representing nodes and links between nodes. This code is useful for creating data visualizations, such as graphs, from hierarchical data with connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing Libraries:\n",
    "The code starts by importing the necessary libraries. The json library is imported to work with JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping Creation Function (create_mapping):\n",
    "The create_mapping function is defined to create a mapping of names to IDs for nodes that are at level 2 within the JSON hierarchy. It traverses the hierarchy using recursion, checking if a child node is at level 2. If it is, the name of the node is assigned an ID, and the mapping dictionary is updated. The function takes two parameters: the current node and the mapping dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Links Creation Function (create_links):\n",
    "The create_links function is defined to create links between nodes based on the \"connectsTo\" values within level 2 nodes. Similar to the mapping function, this function traverses the hierarchy using recursion. For each level 2 child node, it iterates through the \"connectsTo\" keys (connectsTo1 to connectsTo5). If a target name exists in the mapping dictionary, a link is created between the source node (level 2 node) and the target node using their corresponding IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON Data Loading:\n",
    "The code opens and reads an input JSON file named 'reconstructed_dataMOD.json', which contains the hierarchical data to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping Generation:\n",
    "An empty dictionary called name_mapping is initialized to store the mapping of names to IDs. The create_mapping function is called to populate this mapping based on level 2 nodes found in the JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing Mapped Keys:\n",
    "The keys (names) in the name_mapping dictionary are printed to the console. These keys represent the level 2 nodes that have been mapped to unique IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Links Generation:\n",
    "An empty list called links is initialized to store the links between nodes. The create_links function is called to generate links between level 2 nodes based on their \"connectsTo\" values. These links are added to the links list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Data Creation:\n",
    "An output data structure is created to store nodes and links. The nodes list includes dictionaries with 'id' and 'name' keys, representing the mapped IDs and names from the name_mapping dictionary. The links list contains dictionaries representing the source and target IDs for each link.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON Output Creation:\n",
    "The output data structure is converted to JSON format with indentation for readability. The resulting JSON data is written to the 'output.json' file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code takes hierarchical JSON data as input, generates a mapping of names to IDs for level 2 nodes, establishes links between nodes based on specified connections, and produces a new JSON structure suitable for creating visualizations that depict relationships between nodes."
